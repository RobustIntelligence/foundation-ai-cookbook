# Welcome to the Cisco Foundation AI Cookbook
This cookbook repository helps you get started with using models developed by Cisco Foundation AI team. <br>
It will cover many security related use cases, deployment options, practical adaption approaches like finetuning and so forth.

## What is Foundation AI?
