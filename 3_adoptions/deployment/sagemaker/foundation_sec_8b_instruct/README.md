# Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct Model - SageMaker Deployment

This directory contains cookbooks for deploying and running inference with the **Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct model** on Amazon SageMaker.

We provide two sample notebooks:
1. Deploy Models: Deploy Foundation AI models on SageMaker and create an inference endpoint ([link](./deploy.ipynb)).
2. Run Inference: Perform inference using the created endpoint ([link](./inference.ipynb)).

Please note that we assume you already have AWS accounts or contracts and are aware that deployments will incur costs.

For questions about this model or deployment issues, please refer to the main [SageMaker README](../README.md) or consult the AWS SageMaker documentation.
