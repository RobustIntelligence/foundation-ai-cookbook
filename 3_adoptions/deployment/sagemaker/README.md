# Deployment and Inference with Amazon SageMaker AI

We provide two sample notebooks:
1. Deploy Models: Deploy Foundation AI models on SageMaker and create an inference endpoint ([link](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/3_adoptions/deployment/sagemaker/deploy.ipynb)).
2. Run Inference: Perform inference using the created endpoint ([link](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/3_adoptions/deployment/sagemaker/inference.ipynb)).

Please note that we assume you already have AWS accounts or contracts and are aware that deployments will incur costs.
