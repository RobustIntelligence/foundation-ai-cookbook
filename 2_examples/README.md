# 2. Examples
Several use cases of cybersecurity demonstrating how to fully utilize different models.

## Use Cases
### Base Model (Foundation-Sec-8B) based
- [Classifications of cybersecurity descriptions](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/Classification_cybersecurity_descriptions.ipynb) <br>
We also use the base model for fine-tuning use cases. For details, see the [the finetuning section](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/tree/main/3_adoptions/finetuning).

### Reasoning Model based
- [Incident Investigation (end to end)](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/Incident_Investigation_e2e.ipynb)
- [OSINT reconnaissance](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/OSINT_reporting.ipynb)
- [Redteam Planning](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/Redteam_Planning.ipynb)
- [Exploit Generation](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/Exploit_Generation.ipynb)

### Utilizing Instruct Model (instruction fine-tuned model) based
- [YARA patterns](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/YARA_patterns.ipynb)
- [Incident Summarization](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/Incident_Summarization.ipynb)
- [MITRE Mapping](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/Mitre_Mapping_Detection_Plays.ipynb)
- [Build Ennvironment Security (PR review)](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/Build_Environment_Security.ipynb)
- [Config assessment](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/Configuration_Assessment.ipynb)

**Since the Reasoning/Instruct models are in preview mode, youâ€™ll need to request early access via [this form](https://fdtn.ai/early-access). Please note that the models may undergo updates, which can result in variations in outputs even when parameters are set for reproducibility.**
