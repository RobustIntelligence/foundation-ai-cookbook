# 2. Examples
Several use cases of cybersecurity demonstrating how to fully utilize different models.

## Use Cases
### Base Model (Foundation-Sec-8B) based
- [Zero-Shot Classifications of cybersecurity-related text](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/Zero_Shot_Classification.ipynb) <br>
Performs zero-shot classification using perplexity scoring - no fine-tuning required.
- [Classifications of cybersecurity descriptions](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/Classification_cybersecurity_descriptions.ipynb) <br>
We also use the base model for fine-tuning use cases. For details, see the [the finetuning section](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/tree/main/3_adoptions/finetuning).

### Instruction Fine-Tuned Model (Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct) based

- [OSINT reconnaissance](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/OSINT_reporting.ipynb)
- [Redteam Planning](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/Redteam_Planning.ipynb)
- [Exploit Generation](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/Exploit_Generation.ipynb)
- [Root Cause Analysis](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/Root_Cause_Analysis.ipynb)
- [Alert Prioritization](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/Alert_Prioritization.ipynb)
- [Config assessment](https://github.com/RobustIntelligence/foundation-ai-cookbook/blob/main/2_examples/Configuration_Assessment.ipynb)

**Since the Reasoning model is in preview mode, youâ€™ll need to request early access via [this form](https://fdtn.ai/early-access). Please note that the models may undergo updates, which can result in variations in outputs even when parameters are set for reproducibility.**

If you have additional use cases or spot any issues, feel free to share them through discussions, issues, or pull requests.
