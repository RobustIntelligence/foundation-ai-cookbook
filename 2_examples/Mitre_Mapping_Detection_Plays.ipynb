    "\n",
    "Security teams often write detection rules or response playbooks (e.g., for SIEMs, SOAR platforms, or XDRs) but struggle to systematically map them to the right MITRE ATT&CK techniques. This limits the organization’s visibility into detection coverage and hinders frameworks like D3FEND, ATT&CK Navigator, and threat-informed defense.\n",

    "The goal is to automatically analyze each detection play’s logic, objective, and context — and match it to the most relevant ATT&CK technique(s) with high confidence.\n",

Alerts triggered upon script execution help detect this behavior which might be used for post-compromise behaviors like discovery, collection, or other techniques.\n",
